This sustainable energy calculator was a collaboration between
professor of Environmental Studies at Knox College, and Maxwell
Galloway-Carson, a former CS student at that institution.

There are five parts, leading from considering your energy usage, to
the benefits of solar panels and wind turbines. Each part is composed
of two pages, the questions and the results. If the user input is
valid (is numbers) then clicking "Calculate!" will bring the browser
to the result page. The result page is mostly static html, with a few
values filled in dynamically by a javascript file.

The application is entirely client side, using html, css, and
jQuery/javascript. jQuery Mobile is responsible for the application's
look & feel, as well as ajax page transitions.
